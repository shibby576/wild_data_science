# Cornell University, Data Science in the Wild course
This repo contains work from a course that I took while doing my MBA. Below are links to the main projects that are in this repo. Note that some may be incomplete (I unfortunately did not actively maintain my repos then)

### Projects:
<ul>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/shibby576/wild_data_science/blob/master/Assignment_1.ipynb' target='_blank'>Project 1</a> This first project focused on analyzing data, feature engineering with one-hot encoding, and exploring different prediction models (random forest, log reg, xgboost).</li>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/shibby576/wild_data_science/blob/master/Assignment_2.ipynb' target='_blank'>Project 2</a> The goal of this project was to advance data cleansing skills while learning how to make predictions with time series data. In the end, we tried to predict whether it was going to rain in a particular Brazilian city. My final Log Regression model achieved 99% accuracy with an R 2 of .9</li>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/shibby576/wild_data_science/blob/master/Final_Project.ipynb' target='_blank'>Project 3</a> The purpose of this project was to leverage unique data sets as well as data cleansing and modeling techniques learned throughout the course to present some useful insight. Being a dog owner in NYC, I decided to leverage several dog relevant data sets to create a scoring mechanism to determine the best neighborhood to own a dog in. Spoiler, it turned out to be Williamsburg.</li>

</ul>
